#Features and Functionality<br>
The Code Quest application offers several key features designed to help users learn and debug JavaScript code effectively. Here are the main features and how they work:
Code Editor:
The built-in code editor allows users to write JavaScript code directly within the application.
It provides syntax highlighting, making the code easier to read and write.
The user-friendly interface supports easy navigation and editing of the code.
Run Code Button:
The "Run Code" button initiates the debugging process for the code written in the code editor.
Users can click this button to execute their code and check for any errors.
Debugging:
When the "Run Code" button is pressed, the application starts debugging the code.
If there are any syntax errors or issues, the debugging process will identify them, though currently, no specific error messages are displayed in the output section.
Output Section:
The output section displays the result of the executed code.
If the code runs successfully, the output or result is shown in this section.
If there are errors in the code, the output section will not display any results, indicating that the code needs to be corrected.





#Code Examples<br>
At this time, the Code Quest application does not include predefined code examples or sample projects. However, users can start exploring and experimenting with their own JavaScript code using the built-in code editor, run code button, and output section.
We plan to add sample code examples and use cases in future updates to help users get started quickly and see practical applications of JavaScript.


#Customization<br>
Currently, the Code Quest application does not offer customizable settings or configurations. Users can start writing and running their JavaScript code immediately without needing to adjust any settings.
We plan to introduce customization options in future updates to enhance user experience and provide more flexibility in how the application is used.


#Troubleshooting<br>
Common Issues:
Debugging Limitations:
The current version of the Code Quest application does not provide detailed error messages or outline specific problems in the code.
Users may encounter issues where the output section does not display any results if there are errors in the code.
Resolving Issues:
Code Review:
Carefully review your code for any syntax errors or common mistakes.
Ensure that all JavaScript syntax rules are followed correctly.
External Resources:
Use external JavaScript debugging tools or resources to help identify and fix errors.
Refer to online JavaScript documentation and forums for additional support.
Future Improvements:
We are working on adding more advanced debugging features and error messages in future updates to help users identify and resolve issues more effectively.

#Best Practices<br>
To make the most out of the Code Quest application and improve your JavaScript coding skills, follow these best practices:
Avoid Syntax Mistakes:
Double-check your code for any syntax errors.
Ensure all JavaScript syntax rules are followed correctly.
Use Semicolons:
Remember to close your statements with a semicolon (;).
Unlike other programming languages such as Python, JavaScript requires semicolons to terminate statements.



#API Documentation<br>
While the current version of the Code Quest application does not include an API, I am considering adding API functionality in future updates. Below is a suggested structure for potential API endpoints and methods:
User Management:
POST /api/users/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/users/login: Authenticate an existing user.
GET /api/users/:id: Retrieve user details by ID.
PUT /api/users/:id: Update user details.
DELETE /api/users/:id: Delete a user account.
POST /api/code/run: Execute JavaScript code.
Request Body: { "code": "const x = 10; console.log(x);" }
Response: { "output": "10" }
GET /api/code/history: Retrieve the history of executed code for a user.
Feedback:

POST /api/feedback: Submit user feedback.
Request Body: { "userId": "123", "feedback": "Great app!" }
GET /api/feedback: Retrieve all feedback entries.
GET /api/feedback/:id: Retrieve specific feedback by ID.
Suggested Methods
POST: Used to create new resources, such as user accounts, code executions, and feedback entries.
GET: Used to retrieve existing resources, such as user details, code execution history, and feedback entries.
PUT: Used to update existing resources, such as user details.
DELETE: Used to delete existing resources, such as user accounts.
We plan to provide detailed API documentation when these features are implemented in future versions of the application.
